## Storage
### Absolute Variable Location
The Cx51 guidance points out that `_at_` is used to define the variable absolute address in memory space. 
- Bit variables, functions can not use `_at_`.
- `_at_` Variables cannot be initialized.
- To access **XDATA** peripherals, **volatile** keywords is needed to adorn the variables.

## Pointers
### Abstract Pointers
The address in language C is a constant value.

## DataType
### Special Function Register
#### sbit 
The sbit type defines a bit within a special function register (SFR). Only those SFRs whose address is evenly divisible by 8 are bit-addressable. The lower nibble of the SFR's address must be 0 or 8.
